# UPI - Universal Post Install
Your best friend in post installation!

Author: Mirko Brombin

This script allows you to perform actions that are normally performed after installing a Linux distribution. The system automatically detects the distribution and language you are using and executes the appropriate script.

## How to use it?
1. Grab an updated copy from [Releases](https://github.com/mirkobrombin/Universal-Post-Install/releases) section, or clone from GitHub:  
	```git clone https://github.com/mirkobrombin/Universal-Post-Install.git```
2. Unzip and execute **main.py**:
	```./main.py```

## Translations:
Scripts for each distribution are not necessarily written by the same creator of UPI, so it may happen that it is not available in the language of your system. If the script did not find a version that corresponds to your language, it will load it in English.

## Supported Distributions:
- ElementaryOS

## Your distribution is not supported?
Ask for integration in the "Issues" section.
